                    <h3>Group Passing and Post Up</h3>

                    <div class="row uniform 50%">
                        <div class="10u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/allIdeas.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                    </div>

                    <br>
                    <p>We came up with Bully Buster by utilizing the "Group Passing" technique. The five members of our team formed a circle, wrote their ideas down on a sticky note, then passed those ideas to the team member on their left. That team member wrote their contributions to that idea and attached it to the bottom of the sticky note. We did that ten times then selected Bully Buster as the idea with the most potential</p>

                    <p>When next we met, we stuck the original ten sticky notes on a whiteboard then conducted a "Post Up" activity. The goal was simple: Come up with as many uses for Bully Buster as possible in ten minutes, while maintaining silence, and add them to the board. The results of that exercise are pictured above: 30 ideas on 24 notes.</p>

                    <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>

                    <div class="row uniform 50%">
                        <div class="10u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/groupedIdeas.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                    </div>

                    <br>
                    <p>We had a lot of good ideas after the Group Passing and Post Up activities, but they were not organized at all. We fixed that with an "Affinity Diagram" where we came up with categories for our ideas, wrote them on the board, then placed the sticky notes underneath whichever categories we thought were appropriate. This also took ten minutes of silence.</p>

                    <p>The end result was four categories: "Bounty" for the different ways that contractors could be compensated. "Taking Action" for how Bully Buster could take bullying head-on. Monitoring for how the app would track bullying behavior. Reporting for how different users could be informed of bullying.</p>

                    <hr/>

                    <h3>Bull's Eye Diagram</h3>
                    <div class="10u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bullsEyeDiagram.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                    <p>Who exactly are those users? That's what we figured out with a "Bull's Eye Diagram" consisting of four rings. The innermost ring is Bully Buster (formerly "Bully Breaker") itself. Moving outward, there are direct stakeholders, indirect stakeholders, and the wider environment. The more directly a category of users interacts with Bully Buster, the closer they are to the bull's eye.</p>

                    <p>Direct Stakeholders: Developers, elementary schoolers, middle schoolers, and high schoolers.<br>
                        Indirect Stakeholders: Parents, schools, police officers, and app stores.<br>
                        Wider Environment: The media and regulatory bodies.</p>

                    <h3>Forced Ranking</h3>
                    <br>
                    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQDKp1iC-obR3aZBxPLLbMIMpzb6kvy7tuTve5I9BkJjLqUaTWFf5gV7QEotUvlVv6NRDkcm5u6vESH/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
                    <br>
                    <p>We had 30 ideas for what Bully Buster could be or do, but they weren't prioritized and there's no way that we can implement all of them, so we conducted "Forced Ranking" to determine which features should be our top priorities. Each member of our team ranked our features according to which would be most important to two broad user categories (the school children from the Bull's Eye Diagram can be contractors or bullying victims), which have the most potential impact, and which require the least amount of effort to implement. The lower score wins.</p>
